## Almost everything you wanted to know about making tables and figures

 - every table and figure must be referred to from the text
 - the refering sentence should explain what is illustrated, e.g. do not write  "Table 3 shows the difference between groups A and B"  but rather "Group A displayed, on average, higer levels of X compared to B (Table 3)". 
 - tables/figures should be interpretable without the main text --> an intelligent caption is needed (so for graphs, do not just restate the axis labels with a "versus" in between). 
 - Placement of legends (??):
   + for tables: above
   + for graphs: below

 - Do not use titles for graphs included in a paper
 - make every aspect of a graph convey information (do not use color simply because it is pretty)
